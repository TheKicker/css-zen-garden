# CSS Zen Garden

Hello there, thanks for checking this out - it's my own interpretation of CSS Zen Garden in 2017 for an entry level course into HTML at Geneva College

I went with a Mardi Gras theme which is pretty bold, and admittedly (after all these years) painful on the eyes.  But in the moment I loved it and it played a pivotal role in my inspiration for learning and opening the world of possibilities for software development. 

Enjoy!
